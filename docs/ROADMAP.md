# Roadmap

The repository currently focuses on Ansible, but the goal is to reuse the same automation patterns for other stacks and to make onboarding even smoother.

## Short Term

- [ ] **Baseline Release** – capture the current Ansible-focused stack, refresh documentation for the new repo, and tag an initial release candidate that is safe to share publicly.
- [ ] **WSL2 Onboarding Flow** – tighten the Windows bootstrap so a new contributor can run a single PowerShell command, get WSL2 + Docker/Podman configured, and reopen the project in a Dev Container without manual tweaks.
- [ ] **Terraform Ready Stack** – mirror the Ansible toolchain for Terraform by adding core binaries, linting, and smoke tests so infrastructure authors can switch languages without leaving the workspace.
- [ ] **Context Switch Tasks** – ship VS Code tasks (or Make targets) that rebuild `.devcontainer/` for Ansible, Terraform, Python, or Golang in one command to minimise downtime when swapping stacks.

## Medium Term

- [ ] **Unified Testing Story** – extend Molecule/Testinfra coverage to Terraform (e.g. terratest or `terraform validate` smoke jobs) and ensure CI keeps both stacks green.
- [ ] **Template Parity** – audit the Dev Container templates so Ansible, Terraform, Python, and Golang share common features (uv installation, shared caches, VS Code defaults) with stack-specific add-ons layered on top.
- [ ] **Authoring Experience** – add optional content-creation tooling (Markdown preview, diagramming, MkDocs) so blogging or documentation work can happen inside the same container.
- [ ] **Decision on LaTeX** – evaluate whether LaTeX lives in this repo as a first-class template or migrates to a companion repository; document the outcome and provide migration guidance either way.

## Long Term

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Bootstrap** – unify the bootstrap scripts so Windows (WSL2), macOS, and Linux hosts share an opinionated entry point that installs prerequisites and launches the workspace.
- [ ] **Secrets & Policy** – integrate lightweight secrets management (sops/age) and policy tooling (e.g. `tflint`, `opa`) for teams that need security guardrails from day one.
- [ ] **Team Rollout Playbook** – produce reusable Ansible playbooks that roll the baseline stack onto fresh machines, including account setup, editor defaults, and workspace cloning.
- [ ] **Hosted Documentation** – publish a public Quick Start + architecture guide that explains how to consume and extend the baseline, targeting users who discover the project after the GitHub launch.
