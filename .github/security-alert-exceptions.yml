# Security Alert Exceptions Configuration
# This file defines CVEs and patterns that should be auto-dismissed
# Edit this file to customize alert management behavior

# Configuration version (for future compatibility)
version: 1

# Global settings
settings:
  # Maximum age in days before alerts are dismissed as stale
  max_alert_age_days: 90

  # Default dismissal reason for stale alerts
  default_stale_reason: "won't fix"

  # Whether to add comments when dismissing
  add_comments: true

# Known false positives
# These will be dismissed automatically with reason "false positive"
false_positives:
  # Example: CVE that doesn't apply to our use case
  # - cve: "CVE-2024-XXXXX"
  #   reason: "We don't use the affected feature"
  #   comment: "This CVE affects the XYZ module which we have disabled."

# Accepted risks
# These will be dismissed with reason "used in tests"
accepted_risks:
  # Go stdlib and vendor binary CVEs
  # These are pre-compiled binaries from upstream that we don't control
  # Impact: LOW - Development environment only, limited attack surface
  # Review: Quarterly or when upstream releases updates
  vendor_binary_cves:

    comment: "Medium severity alert auto-dismissed after 90 days with no fix available."

# Tool-specific rules

  trivy:
    # Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities (Trivy already does this, but documented here)
    ignore_unfixed: true

    # Custom dismissal patterns
    patterns:
      # Example: Dismiss Go stdlib vulnerabilities in copied binaries
      # - location_pattern: "usr/local/bin/*"
      #   package_pattern: "golang.org/x/*"
      #   days: 60
      #   reason: "used in tests"
