# CVE-2024-12345 - package-name
# Reason: No fix available / Transitive dependency / False positive
# Plan: Monitor for updates
# Expires: 2025-01-15

# CVE-2024-45337 - golang.org/x/crypto (transitive dependency in age binary)
# Affected: age v1.2.1 (latest version as of 2025-12-07)
# Reason: Transitive dependency in pre-compiled age/age-keygen binaries
#         Age is a file encryption tool, not used for SSH server operations
#         The vulnerability is in SSH server code (ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback)
#         which is not relevant to age's file encryption use case
# Risk: Low - age doesn't use the vulnerable SSH server functionality
# Plan: Monitor age releases for updated golang.org/x/crypto dependency
