# Trivy Ignore File
# Vulnerabilities that cannot be fixed or are false positives
# Format: CVE-YYYY-NNNNN or path pattern

# Example files (not production code)
# Ignore vulnerabilities in examples/ directory as they are templates
# that users will customize with their own dependencies

# ---
# Path-based ignores
# Trivy supports ignoring specific paths using comments
# Use this for documentation and examples

# CVE entries to ignore
# Document each with: CVE, affected package, reason, plan
# Example:
# CVE-2024-12345 - package-name
# Reason: No fix available / Transitive dependency / False positive
# Plan: Monitor for updates
# Expires: 2025-01-15

# CVE-2024-45337 - golang.org/x/crypto (transitive dependency in age binary)
# Affected: age v1.2.1 (latest version as of 2025-12-07)
# Reason: Transitive dependency in pre-compiled age/age-keygen binaries
#         Age is a file encryption tool, not used for SSH server operations
#         The vulnerability is in SSH server code (ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback)
#         which is not relevant to age's file encryption use case
# Risk: Low - age doesn't use the vulnerable SSH server functionality
# Plan: Monitor age releases for updated golang.org/x/crypto dependency
#       https://github.com/FiloSottile/age/releases
# Expires: 2025-03-01
